# Conformance registry

This registry reserves stable identifiers for the tests required by the design. An identifier remains
stable when its test moves from planned to executable; the design's representative-test table carries
the detailed assertion.

| id | assertion |

| CONF-14b | `transcoding` extension offset behavior |
| CONF-15 | POST transcode decision and opaque-parameter stream round-trip |
| CONF-16 | transcode concurrency limiter returns 429 with `Retry-After`, mapped to `Server.Busy` |
| CONF-17 | cold legacy-transcode `Content-Length` estimate semantics |
| CONF-21 | whether `playbackReport` increments play count — not a Phase-1 test |
